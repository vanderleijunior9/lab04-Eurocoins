💰 Euro Coin Change Calculator 💰
📝 Description
This C++ program calculates the minimum number of Euro coins needed to make up a given amount of change (less than one Euro). It breaks down the change into 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, and 1 cent coins and displays the result.

🚀 How It Works

Input the amount of change (in cents) when prompted.
